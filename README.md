Jimmy Yodeler: Military Voice Procedure Trainer
Overview
Jimmy Yodeler is a web-based training application designed to teach military voice procedures to signal operator trainees. Inspired by interactive language learning platforms, this tool uses call-and-response training, voice recognition, and audio feedback to enhance communication skills in simulated military environments.

Features
Voice Interaction Modules
Whisper API for voice-to-text transcription.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) with audio band filtering for realism.
Training Scenarios
Library of pre-scripted military communication drills.
Real-time response evaluation and scoring (out of 100).
Feedback System
Immediate corrective feedback.
Performance tracking with visual graphing and analytics.
User Authentication
Secure login for trainees and administrators.
Admin Dashboard
View trainee progress and analyze training effectiveness.
System Architecture
Frontend
Web UI: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive interface.
Client-Side Logic: Handles user interactions and API communication.
Backend
Server: Node.js/Express for API handling.
Performance-Critical Modules: Developed in C++ for real-time processing.
Core Integrations
Whisper API → Converts trainee voice input into text.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) → Generates filtered military-style radio communications.
MySQL Database → Stores:
User credentials.
Training scripts.
Accuracy scores and feedback.
Workflow
Trainee logs in and selects a training scenario.
The system plays a pre-recorded message using TTS.
The trainee responds using their voice.
The system:
Converts speech to text via Whisper API.
Compares the response to the expected script.
Scores the accuracy and provides immediate feedback.
If accuracy is low, the trainee is prompted to repeat the message.
Results are stored and visualized in the trainee's dashboard.
